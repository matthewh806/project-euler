# project-euler

My solutions for [Project Euler] https://projecteuler.net written in [Swift] https://swift.org

This is part of my ongoing quest to learn more about number theory and the Swift language.

## Build Instructions
-----------------------
1. clone `project-euler`

    ```sh
    cd ~/projects
    git clone git@github.com:matthewh806/project-euler.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have the latest [Swift Development Snapshot] (https://swift.org/download/) and follow the [Getting Started guide] (https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift)

3. Building an executable with the follwing command: 

    ```sh
    swift build
    ```

4. The built products can then be found in the `.build` directory. Run the program with the following command:

    ```sh
    .build/debug/project-euler [n]
    ```

Note that `[n]` specifies the problem no. you wish to view the output for.
